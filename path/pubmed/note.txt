Didn't copy over the contents of abstracts_split and full_search_pubmed_lim100000 from the cluser where the query was performed.
These directories contain a massive number of files and are all intermediate.
The query that was run was just the six species names connected by OR, and the search was capped at 100,000 abstracts.
The files derived from these that are actually used downstream are:
1. combined_abstracts.txt (used to train word2vec models)
2. split_sentences.txt (used to train doc2vec models).
